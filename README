We use the -label flag of the image magick convert command to
generate the text contained in the MESSAGE variable on a white background.
The image is saved as a png and is named according to the number of
seconds passed since January 1, 1970. (see: Posix time)
Then, we calculate a cross product of the image obtained to have the
length of the ticket in millimeters to print.
We send this image to the printer via the lp command of the utility
cups, specifying the dimensions calculated in millimeters.

Dependencies

                           /!\ important /!\ 
banderole.sh is supplied WITHOUT a thermal printer. It is necessary
to have access to such a tool to print a banner. I use a
Epson TM-T20II which prints up to 80mm wide and connects via USB,
there are plenty of others, you have to hunt around...
